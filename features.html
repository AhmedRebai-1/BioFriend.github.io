                The amount of sunlight your plant needs depends on which variety you grow. Many plants,
                including lots of flowers, grasses, and trees, grow better in spots with 6 or more hours of
                sunlight a day. Watch your environment to see how the sunlight changes throughout the day.
                <br/> See information on your plant's sunlight requirements before planting.
                <br/> See information on your plant’s temperature and humidity.
